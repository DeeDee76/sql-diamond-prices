<H2>Data Details</H2>

There are 53,940 diamonds in the dataset with 10 features (carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, and z). Most variables are numeric in nature, but the variables cut, color, and clarity are ordered factor variables with the following levels.

About the currency for the price column: it is Price ($)

And About the columns x,y, and z they are diamond measurements as (( x: length in mm, y: width in mm,z: depth in mm ))

<H2>Notes</H2>
* Column names changed due to keywords in the dataset that are not allowed in sql server.
