<H1>Project Info</H1>
I'm using the diamond prices kaggle data and sql to create metrics on the prices of diamonds. Visit this repository's <a href="https://github.com/DeeDee76/sql-diamond-prices/wiki">Wiki</a> for a detailed explanation of the steps.

<H2>Data Details</H2>

As of April 2020, the price of a one carat diamond with the properties G - VS2 was approximately 4,570 euros, while the price of a one carat diamond with the properties H - Sl1 were valued at approximately 3,730 euros. Diamonds vary significantly in price depending on their size and characteristics.

There are 53,940 diamonds in the dataset with 10 features (carat, cut, color, clarity, depth, table, price, x, y, and z). Most variables are numeric in nature, but the variables cut, color, and clarity are ordered factor variables with the following levels.

About the currency for the price column: it is Price ($)

And About the columns x,y, and z they are diamond measurements as (( x: length in mm, y: width in mm,z: depth in mm ))

<H2>Notes</H2>

* I changed one column name (table) because it's a keyword in sql server.
